/*
Problem #16: Sine Function
Author: Corey Prak
Date Created: 05/06/2014

Description: Read an integer or floating point value from the command line. It will come into your program as argv[1]. Remember that argv[1]â€™s type is a pointer to a character that begins a sequence of characters that end in a null byte. In other words, it is what is agreed upon as a string.

For example, 
bash>./a.out 4.3

Print out the trigonometric sine value of this number.  You would do this by calling the proper function that is found in Appendix D of you textbook. 

Comments:
Observing the math package found at http://golang.org/pkg/math/#Sqrt it can easily be observed that the function Sin does exactly what we need it to do! I <3 Go.

Also was pretty cool having to use the strconv package.

package main

import(
  "math"
  "fmt"
  "os"
  "strconv"
)

func main() {
  // Variable which will hold the user's floating point argument. 
  var cmdLineInput float64
  var parseError error

  // Make sure that there's at lease some kind of argument supplied. We can't assume.
  if len(os.Args) < 2 {
    fmt.Printf("\nERROR, requires floating point argument. Exiting...\n\n")
    return
  }

  // The command line argument should be a float, but is of type string. Use ParseFloat to interpret it as a 64 bit floating point number.
  cmdLineInput, parseError = strconv.ParseFloat(os.Args[1], 64)
  if parseError != nil {
    fmt.Printf("\nERROR: %v. Exiting...\n\n", parseError)
    return
  }

  fmt.Printf("\nThe sine of %f is %f.\n\n", cmdLineInput, math.Sin(cmdLineInput))
}
