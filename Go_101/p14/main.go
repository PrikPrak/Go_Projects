Problem #14: Argc

Description:
Write a C program that prints the number of command line arguments. This is the number that is stored in the argument: argc.  Do not lose points because your code has a ragged indent or a misspelled word. For example,

bash>  ./a.out would print out 1
bash>  ./a.out 511 Mel Ott Life is good               would print out 7
bash>  ./a.out  Jem and Scout                                     would  print out 4


Comments:
//	fmt.Printf("\nThere are %d command line arguments.\n\n", strconv.atoi(os.Args()));
^lol, why the heck did I write this?

  } else {
    fmt.Printf("\nThere is one command line argument.\n\n", argLength)
  }
