/*
Problem #18: Solid Box of Asterisks
Author: Corey Prak
Date Created: 04/03/2014

Description: Your task is to write a C program that accepts two positive integer values from the keyboard, say L and H. Both L and H will be less than 21. Your program then prints out a solid of box of asterisks, with L horizontal stars and H vertical stars. The box is filled with asterisks. For example,

If you were to type in 5 and 3, you output would be:

*****
***** 
*****

Comments: YAY, we're finally at loops!!!

  //Integer variables that will contain user submitted length and height.

  var i, j int

  fmt.Printf("\n\nPlease enter two integer values which will be used to determine the size of a box of asterisks. Both values must be less than 21, for length and height, respectively: ")

  //Also possible to read in one integer at a time, just wanted to show that this was possible as well. In my limited experience with golang's format specifiers, they must not have any spaces between them; compiler will complain.

  //Debugging
  fmt.Printf("\nLength:%d, Height:%d\n", length, height)

  //There are so many ways to design this portion of error checking. It's possible to do some error handling, or have a loop that will continuously keep asking for valid input, or something entirely different...

  //Spacing.
  fmt.Printf("\n\n")

  //i is already set to its default value of 0 when declared, just being explicit to demonstrate the first format of a for loop.
  //Demonstrates the first format of a loop: for *init incrementer* ; *condition* ; *incrementer modification* {}
  //Increment modification simply adds one to the current value of i, assigns back to the variable.
  for i = 0; i < height; i = i + 1 {
  
    //Demonstrates the second form of a for loop, albeit simpler: for *condition* {}
    //Note the particular notation that modifies the increment. j += 1 is synonymous with j = j + 1.
