Go_Projects
===========

This repository represents my recorded work in learning Go. There are mainly four directories:

     
##Go_101##
A repo containing my progress in completing C_101, a document which resembles "Project Euler" containing 101 programming problems that are based on the C programming language, created by James Canning of the University of Massachusetts Lowell. More-so a coach than Professor who helped me and decades of other CS students to, "build my base" and realize who the greatest basketball player of all time is (Bill Russell). 


##Examples##
A soon to be organized mashup of example programs that strengthened my understanding of the language. 


##Notes##
Random notes that have been created on my own account. For personal reference. Not something I would consider dependable to anyone else since content may be inaccurate, but I definitely plan to refine it in the future to benefit others.


##Projects##
Directories of personal projects that I intend to develop as my experience in Go increases.

I've tried to make every commit as detailed as possible, describing exactly which folder modifications were made to. The commits are also designed to represent a change in only one directory. In the future, if I ever do intend to flesh out each directory into their own repository, I can simply filter out the commits pertaining to a particular folder.
